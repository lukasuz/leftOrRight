# leftOrRight

After finishing my data mining course I wanted to apply the whole process in an own project. From getting the data, preprocessing it, train a model and make a prediciton given input. Here I dynamically take comments from left and right winged subreddits, save and preprocess them and then train a neural 
network based on that data. With a simple model I could achieve an accuracy of 72% classifying a comment either right oder left winged.

**This project should be taken with a grain of salt.**
